; A normal `for (int i = start; i < n; i++)` (i32 IV from an unknown start, so
; SCEV gives no constant trip bound and short-loop deletion leaves it alone).
; The per-batch stride is |step| * chunk-iters; with a budget of 3e9 that does
; not fit the i32 IV as a positive stride (it sits between 2^31 and 2^32), which
; would overflow the saturating-clamp arithmetic. The pass must bail and leave
; the loop and its poll untouched rather than miscompile. This is the only
; realistically reachable trigger for the overflow guard: a clean i32/i64 IV
; whose budget fits would instead be short-loop-deletable before mining runs.
